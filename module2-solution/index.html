				1. Usain Bolt
			</h1>
			<p class="textbody">
				Bolt’s individual Olympics came to a close on August 18, 2016 as the only person in the history of Athletics to win three consecutive 100 and 200-meter Olympic gold medals. 9.58 100; 19.19 200; 14.35 150 — all world records. Want further proof of his greatness? In 2013 Bolt became the only man to ever become three-time 200 World Champion. No one has ran faster and probably never will. EVER!

				2. Jesse Owens

			<div class="textbody">
				Owens won the Berlin Games, the 100 in 10.3 and the 200 in 20.7. Not impressive times until you consider that they were ran in 1936 in dirt. You put Owens on a synthetic track, with blocks, weight training and lighter spikes, he would easily run under a 9.7.

				3. Justin Gatlin
			</div>
			<div class="textbody">
				Before a doping suspension took four years of his career away from him, Gatlin was the fastest man in the world. He won six consecutive NCAA titles — in TWO seasons — as a collegian and tied the world record of 9.77 in 2006. He returned from his suspension in 2010 to win the 2012 World Indoor Championships in the 60-meters (6.46) and a bronze in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games (9.79). Gatlin also became the first American to win a medal in three Olympics after his silver in the Rio Games in 2016.
